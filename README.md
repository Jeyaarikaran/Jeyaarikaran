## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software applications. It defines a series of steps that guide teams through the planning, creation, testing, deployment, and maintenance of a software product. The goal of SDLC is to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, within time and budget constraints.

## 1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
The first phase of SDLC is gathering requirements from stakeholders such as clients, end-users, and business analysts. These requirements define what the software is supposed to do. Once collected, the information is analyzed for feasibilityâ€”technically, operationally, and economically. The result is a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document, which acts as a foundation for all future phases.

## 2. Planning
In this phase, the development team creates a detailed project plan. This includes estimating costs, allocating resources, setting timelines, and identifying potential risks. Proper planning helps avoid delays, budget overruns, and miscommunication during the later stages of development.

## 3. Design
System design transforms the requirements into a visual and logical structure. It consists of two parts:

High-Level Design (HLD): Defines system architecture, modules, and data flow.

Low-Level Design (LLD): Details algorithms, data structures, database designs, and user interfaces.

The output of this phase includes design documents and prototypes.

 ## 4. Development
In this phase, developers write code based on the design specifications. They follow programming standards and use tools and technologies appropriate for the project. Each module is developed and tested individually using unit testing to ensure it functions correctly.
## 5. Testing
After development, the software undergoes rigorous testing to find and fix bugs. Various types of testing are performed, such as:

Unit Testing

Integration Testing

System Testing

User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Testing ensures the software is reliable, secure, and meets the functional requirements.


## 6. Deployment
Once the product is tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment. It can be released to a limited user base (beta release) or launched fully. Deployment involves installing the software, configuring the system, and training users if necessary.

## 7. Maintenance
Even after deployment, software requires regular maintenance. This includes fixing unexpected issues (corrective), adapting the software to changes in the environment (adaptive), or adding new features (perfective). Continuous maintenance ensures the software remains functional and up-to-date.

## Conclusion
The SDLC is essential for managing complex software projects. It ensures a methodical approach to software creation, helping teams deliver reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly products. By following the SDLC, organizations can minimize risks, improve productivity, and achieve customer satisfaction.
